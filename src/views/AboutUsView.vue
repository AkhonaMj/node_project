<p>Meet Richter Valentine the founder of Valentine’s and where the name comes from. He started this business when he was just 18. His journey is an interesting one. Working at a suit shop similar to Valentine’s who went bankrupt. He purchased their remaining stock and begun selling them via telephone to interested buyers. Thus Valentine’s was born. Soon he had enough money to buy property and the rest is history.</p>
